# BlackHoleAttack

Simulation of Blackhole attack in Network Simulator 3

Mobile devices form an integral part of our lives and their importance cannot be under-
stated,also they can construct network proactively to exchange information where the
conventional communication infrastructure are not exist. We call this kind of network
environment as Ad Hoc Network. However, the Ad Hoc Network has vulnerability in
data security due to its characteristics of network protocol. The Blackhole Attack is one
of the major contributor in the risks vulnerable to the Ad Hoc Network as an attacker
makes faulty route by responding fake network information to the information source,
and intercepts data through faulty route they made.
In this project we first analyzed various Vehicular Adhoc Network protocols like AODV,DSR
and DSDV and performed real-time simulation by integrating SUMO and NS-3.Also,we
scrutinized the application of routing protocols in the above scenario.
The working of Blackhole attack was simulated on NS-3 and the analysis was made using
PyViz visualizer which helped us to construct an in-depth understanding of the flaws in
the routing protocols.
